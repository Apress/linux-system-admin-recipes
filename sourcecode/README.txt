This zipfile contains various of the scripts and config files that are
referred to or printed in the book.

All the scripts should work as-is; in some cases you may need to install
particular Perl modules (this will be discussed in the relevant recipe in the
book).  

Not all of the config files are full files: in some cases they're snippets
that you need to put into the full file.  Again, see the relevant recipe(s) in
the book for more information.  

In most cases you will need to make adjustments to variables (server names,
filenames, etc) before using config files or scripts.  

Please let me know (juliet@earth.li) of any problems encountered.
